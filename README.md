Hi there, fellow gamer and developer! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate enthusiast of game development, gaming, computer hardware, and software development. I love creating and playing games that challenge, entertain, and inspire me.

Iâ€™m currently learning and building a game in Unreal Engine 5, the most powerful and advanced game engine in the world. Iâ€™m amazed by the possibilities and features that UE5 offers, such as Nanite, Lumen, and MetaHuman Creator.

Iâ€™m also a fan of older games that have a nostalgic and classic feel to them. Some of the games that Iâ€™m currently playing are:

Gears 5, the fifth installment of the epic Gears of War franchise that combines brutal action, stunning graphics, and immersive storytelling.
Fortnite, the popular battle royale game that mixes survival, shooting, and building elements in a colorful and cartoonish world.
Phasmophobia, the terrifying co-op horror game that puts you in the role of a paranormal investigator who has to face ghosts and demons.
Deep Rock Galactic, the cooperative sci-fi shooter that lets you explore and mine procedurally generated caves full of alien creatures and precious minerals.
Fatal Company, the fast-paced and tactical multiplayer shooter that pits you against other players in various modes and maps.
Dead Island, the open-world zombie game that blends survival, RPG, and melee combat in a tropical paradise gone wrong.
Dying Light, the parkour-based zombie game that features a dynamic day and night cycle, a crafting system, and a gripping story.
If you share any of these interests or games, feel free to connect with me and chat with me. Iâ€™m always open to learning new things, exchanging ideas, and having fun. ðŸ˜Š
